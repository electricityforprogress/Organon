# Organon
Biodata for Eurorack

This device can connect to the leaves of a plant and produces three pairs of Note CV and Gate signals, along with outputs for the 'raw' PWM Biodata square wave, a 'wiggly' CV output, and MIDI out!  The Organon comes with a set of snap electrode leads and three pairs of sticky pads. 
Using an Arduino Pro Micro 32u4, LMC555 timer, and a MC4728 Quad DAC this device was quite hard to find parts for until late 2023.
